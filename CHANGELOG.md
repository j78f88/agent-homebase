# Changelog

## Supported versions

| Version | Status                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 3.0.x   | Supported (security + bug fixes)    |
| 2.0.x   | Security fixes only                 |
| 1.x     | Unsupported                         |
| < 1.0   | Unsupported                         |

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the disclosure process and the
support window once 2.1 ships.

## Deprecation timeline

| Surface                       | Deprecated in | Removed in |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| `scope:` frontmatter alias    | 2.0.0         | **3.0.0**  |
| `jsonschema.RefResolver` path | 2.0.0         | **2.1.0**  |

The `scope:` → `applies_to` migrator
(`tools/migrate-frontmatter.py`) keeps working through all 2.x and
3.x releases.

## Planned for 2.1

- Migrate off `jsonschema.RefResolver` to `referencing`.
- Adopter template repository (one-line `git clone` + `init.py`).
- PyPI distribution (`pip install agent-homebase`).
- Authoring linter for skill/instruction/agent frontmatter (catches
  contract violations before `init.py` runs).

## Known limitations (2.0.0)

- No PyPI package; install is `git clone` + `pip install -r ...`.
- No adopter template repo yet — adopters work from `profiles/*`.
- Windows authoring requires UTF-8-without-BOM git config; the
  `.githooks/commit-msg` hook (installed via
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) rejects BOM commits.
- `jsonschema.RefResolver` deprecation warning surfaces in
  `tests/test_protocol_v1_conformance.py`. Functional; planned
  migration in 2.1.
- macOS is not exercised in CI; reports welcome.

## 3.0.1 — 2026-05 — enforcement gates and heading hierarchy

This release adds **no new policy**. It adds automated regression
protection for the conventions established in 3.0.0 and normalises a
small number of pseudo-headings that were missed by the 3.0.0 voice
pass.

### Added
- **`tests/test_skill_length.py`** — enforces the 200-line cap on
  `skills/*/*.skill.md` documented in `docs/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md`.
  Supporting files in the same skill directory are excluded from the
  count.
- **`tests/test_skill_description.py`** — enforces the four description
  rules from the authoring guide: ≤ 1024 characters, capital first
  letter, presence of a `Use <when|after|to|with|on|...>` trigger
  sentence, and the description must not lead with the skill name.
- **`tests/test_voice_compliance.py`** — fails on bare all-caps
  prohibitions (`MUST`, `NEVER`, `DO NOT`) and on hedging words
  (`consider`, `perhaps`, `might`, `may be useful`, `you could`) in
  skill files. Code spans, link targets, and YAML frontmatter are
  ignored.
- **`tests/test_doc_headings.py`** — fails on standalone bold-only
  lines (pseudo-headings) in user-facing documentation. Inline bold
  field labels in lists and prose are unaffected. Scope: top-level
  user-facing docs (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `CONTEXT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ANTI_FRAGILITY.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, and every top-level `docs/*.md`). Internal sprint records and the long-form
  `sandbox-architecture.instructions.md` are out of scope by design.

### Changed
- **`skills/onboarding/onboarding.skill.md`** description gained a
  `Use when` trigger sentence to satisfy the new description rule.
- **`README.md`** tagline converted from bold paragraph to italic
  subtitle.
- **`ANTI_FRAGILITY.md`** four `**Mitigation.**` pseudo-headings
  converted to `### Mitigation`.
- **`docs/BEST_PRACTICE_ALIGNMENT_JOURNAL.md`** locked-baseline
  pseudo-heading converted to `### Locked baseline`.
- **`docs/ONBOARDING.md`** four `**Option A/B — ...**` pseudo-headings
  converted to `### Option A/B — ...`.
- **`docs/POLICY_AUDIT.md`** `**Proposed disposition**` pseudo-heading
  converted to `### Proposed disposition`.
- **`docs/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md`** clarified that the opening
  paragraph IS the skill Overview (mandatory, headingless, sits
  between H1 and `## When to Use`).
- **`CONTEXT.md`** clarified voice-rule scope: rules apply to
  agent-facing prose, not to structured artifacts (ADRs, JSON schemas,
  reference checklists in `references/`).
- **`v3uplift/QA_REPORT.md`** appended a remediation-status redux
  section: 6 of 7 critical violations closed, 1 accepted deviation
  (CV-06, dead ADR-0008 reference in a historical sprint run-sheet).
- **`v3uplift/JOURNEY.md`** filled in phase status table, lessons
  learned, and "what would change" retrospective.
- **`src/__init__.py` `__version__`** bumped to `3.0.1`.
- **`config/plugin.json` `version`** bumped to `3.0.1`.

### Verified
- 395 pytest tests pass / 7 skipped (233 baseline + 162 parametrised
  enforcement cases from the four new tests).
- `python init.py --config config/project.config.example.yml` builds
  clean with byte-identical output across two consecutive runs.

### Changed
- Moved `ANTI_FRAGILITY.md` and `CONTEXT.md` to `docs/` (root declutter)
- Completed AGENTS.md Key directories table (all 17 directories)

### Added
- Per-directory READMEs for `src/`, `hooks/`, `starters/`, `tools/`
- `starters/copilot-instructions.md` platform entry point template
- `/tools/` entry in CODEOWNERS



### Added
- **Skill authoring guide** (`docs/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md`) — canonical
  reference for writing skills: section order, voice rules, prohibition
  style, description format, and governance requirements.
- **Domain glossary** (`CONTEXT.md`) — single source of truth for every
  domain term used across skills, instructions, and documentation.
- **Hard/soft dependency ADR**
  (`docs/decisions/0001-hard-soft-instruction-dependencies.md`) —
  classifies each instruction as hard (requires project config tokens)
  or soft (works standalone).

### Changed
- **All 13 skills audited and rewritten** to conform to the authoring
  guide: consistent section order, imperative voice, bold lowercase
  prohibitions (`**never**`, `**must**`, `**do not**`).
- **Voice unification** across documentation, instructions, and agent
  bodies — passive voice and hedging words removed from agent-facing
  content.
- **Cross-references corrected** — stale file counts, dead ADR links,
  and inconsistent build commands fixed.
- **`src/__init__.py` `__version__`** bumped to `3.0.0`.
- **`config/plugin.json` `version`** bumped to `3.0.0`.

### Breaking
- **Prohibition style standardised:** all skills use bold lowercase
  keywords (`**never**`, `**must**`, `**do not**`). Agent bodies use
  `**Never** verb phrase` at list-item start (documented convention).
- **Skill section order standardised:** all 13 skills follow the
  canonical template from the authoring guide.

### Verified
- 233 pytest tests pass / 7 skipped.
- `python init.py --config config/project.config.example.yml` builds
  clean with deterministic output.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-05 — `protocol-v1` ships complete

### Added
- **Four JSON Schemas under `schemas/`** that gate the build:
  `frontmatter-v1`, `callable-v1`, `project-v1`, `registry-v1`.
- **`validate_frontmatter()` in `init.py`** — strict by default. Every
  skill, instruction, and agent body is validated against
  `frontmatter-v1`; skills additionally validated against
  `callable-v1`. Use `--allow-frontmatter-warnings` for lax mode.
- **`callable-v1` manifests on all 13 skills** (`inputs`, `outputs`,
  `verifier`). Verifier callables declare `verifier: null` per ADR-0009.
- **Mode-2 reference implementation**
  ([`command-centre/03-mode-orchestration/reference-impls/file-queue-dispatcher/`](../command-centre/03-mode-orchestration/reference-impls/file-queue-dispatcher/))
  — file-backed queue dispatcher with a finite-state machine, freshness
  check, and a passing `conformance_test.py`.
- **Mode-3 reference implementation**
  ([`command-centre/04-mode-choreography/reference-impls/registry-coordinator/`](../command-centre/04-mode-choreography/reference-impls/registry-coordinator/))
  — fleet coordinator that validates a registry, detects contract drift,
  reports contract-bump impact, harvests audit JSON, and ships three
  meta-agents (`framework-dev`, `harvest`, `audit`). Includes a passing
  `conformance_test.py`.
- **Conformance tests** under `tests/test_protocol_v1_conformance.py`
  (schema self-validation, every substrate file validates, fixture
  registry validates, both reference-impl conformance scripts run
  clean) and unit tests under `tests/test_frontmatter_validation.py`.
- **`tools/migrate-frontmatter.py`** — idempotent migrator that brings
  legacy substrate into `frontmatter-v1` shape (renames `scope:` to
  `applies_to:`, adds `id`/`kind`/`version`, seeds default
  `callable-v1` manifest on skills missing one).
- **`jsonschema>=4.0`** added to `requirements.txt`.

### Changed
- **`applies_to:` is canonical, `scope:` is a legacy read-only alias.**
  Per ADR-0012. The validator accepts both on read; new files must use
  `applies_to`. All 25 instruction files and 13 agent body files were
  migrated.
- **`init.py` agent generation** now parses frontmatter on
  `agents/*.body.md` and emits only the body into generated
  `.agent.md`, so newly-added frontmatter is not duplicated.
- **`README.md`** rewritten around `protocol-v1`, the three modes, and
  the four schemas.
- **`src/__init__.py` `__version__`** bumped to `2.0.0`.

### Deprecated
- **`scope:` frontmatter field.** Still accepted on read as an alias for
  `applies_to:`; will be removed in a future major. Run
  `python tools/migrate-frontmatter.py` to migrate.

### Removed
- **`resolved/` and `.agent-state/` from version control.** Both are
  build/runtime output. `.gitignore` updated; existing tracked files
  untracked via `git rm -r --cached`.

### Migration
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (picks up `jsonschema`).
2. `python tools/migrate-frontmatter.py` to rename `scope:` →
   `applies_to:` and seed missing IDs/kinds.
3. For any custom skills, add a `callable-v1` manifest (`inputs`,
   `outputs`, `verifier`). See [docs/EXTENSION_GUIDE.md](EXTENSION_GUIDE.md).
4. `python init.py --config <your-config>` — strict frontmatter
   validation is on by default. Use `--allow-frontmatter-warnings`
   only as a temporary escape hatch.

### Verified
- 233 pytest tests pass / 7 skipped.
- `python init.py --config profiles/python-api.config.yml` runs twice
  with byte-identical `resolved/` output (determinism preserved).
- Both reference-impl `conformance_test.py` scripts pass standalone
  and via pytest.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-04-30

### Added
- **@onboarding skill** — guided first-time setup agent that walks deployers through profile selection, config filling, skill selection, token resolution, file deployment, seeding, and verification. Self-removes after setup is complete.
- `lifecycle: setup-only` frontmatter field — skills with this value are excluded from `resolved/` output when `setup_complete: true` in config. Stale resolved output is cleaned automatically.
- `setup_complete` config field in `project.config.example.yml` (default: `false`).
- `agents/onboarding.body.md` — lean agent wrapper body for the onboarding skill.

### Changed
- **docs.skill.md** — full review and update:
  - Added Subagent Mode section (sprint-lead invokes @docs as subagent; was undocumented).
  - Added Anti-Patterns section with 7 docs-specific patterns.
  - Added Interaction Style section with `askQuestions` decision points.
  - Added `subagent-return-schemas.instructions.md` to Shared Rules.
  - Replaced hardcoded "Australian English" with `{{project.locale}}` token.
  - Removed project-specific references (Wizard steps, `.github/` paths, `UpdateNotification`, feature matrix exclusions, emoji heading markers).
  - Fixed broken step numbering in Sync Workflow (was: 1-5, 5-8, 7-10, 11, 12; now: sequential 1-15).
  - Converted user_guide mega-paragraph into scannable checklist.
  - Added section separators (`---`) for visual consistency.
  - Simplified README validation to be project-agnostic.
- `init.py` — reads `setup_complete` from config; skips `lifecycle: setup-only` skills and cleans stale resolved output during resolution.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Dual-platform agent generation** — `init.py` generates VS Code `.agent.md` wrappers from skill `agent:` metadata when `editor.target` includes `\"vscode\"`.
- `editor.target` config option: `\"vscode\"` | `\"claude-code\"` | `\"both\"` (default). Added to example config and all 3 profiles.
- `resolved/agents/` output directory with 13 generated agent wrappers.
- `agent:` frontmatter block on all 13 skills — `tools`, `agents`, `model`, `handoffs`.
- Tool restriction mapping: `reviewer` is read-only, `architect`/`pm` are read+search, `sprint-lead` gets agent delegation, `researcher` gets web access.
- `parse_frontmatter()`, `extract_agent_body()`, `generate_agent_md()`, `generate_agents()`, and `suppress_skill_invocability()` functions in `init.py`.
- Editor target validation in `SecurityValidator`.

### Changed
- Skills set to `user-invocable: false` in resolved output when agents are generated with `editor.target: \"vscode\"` (prevents duplicate discovery).
- README updated with platform selection table, project structure, and agent copy step.
- ONBOARDING.md updated with `editor.target` guidance, `resolved/agents/` copy step, and verification checks.
- ARCHITECTURE.md updated with dual-platform overview and resolved output structure.
- CUSTOMIZATION.md updated with platform selection section and agent metadata customization.
- SKILL_FLOW.md updated with agent wrapper column in skill inventory.

### Corrections (previously undocumented)
- **Fixed**: Skill source files renamed from `SKILL.md` to `{name}.skill.md` (e.g., `architect.skill.md`) for unique identification in editor tabs and file pickers. `init.py` resolves these to `SKILL.md` in output per VS Code convention.
- 5 generic instruction files added across v1.0–v1.2 but not recorded in prior changelog entries: `determinism-guarantees.instructions.md`, `fsm-orchestration.instructions.md`, `observability.instructions.md`, `security-model.instructions.md`, `state-management.instructions.md`.
- `severity-levels.instructions.md` moved from `instructions/generic/` to `instructions/configurable/`.
- `user-invocable: true` added to `docs`, `planner`, `pm`, and `sprint-lead` skills (was missing from frontmatter).
- Instruction count corrected across all documentation: 10 generic + 14 configurable = 24 total (was incorrectly stated as 23).
- Agent/skill count corrected: 12 roles (was incorrectly stated as 11 in several docs — missed updating after `@security` was added in v1.1.0).
- ONBOARDING.md updated to list `@security` in skill selection guidance.
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md updated to include `security` in skill folder checklist.
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md target structure updated to reflect current state (security skill, agents/, new instruction files, starter files, resolved/agents/).

## 1.2.0 — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **7 new security checks** (8–14): SBOM generation, SAST scanning, git history secret scanning, license compliance, HTTP security headers, container image scanning, IaC scanning.
- **Remediation playbook** — 4-case OWASP decision tree classifying each finding into patched/delayed/no-fix/zero-day with timelines and effort tags.
- New config tokens: `commands.sbom_generate`, `commands.sast`, `commands.secret_scan_history`, `commands.license_check`, `commands.container_scan`, `commands.iac_scan`, `paths.sbom_output`, `security.sbom_format`, `security.scan_git_history`, `security.license_gate`, `security.license_denylist`, `security.license_allowlist`, `security.check_security_headers`, `security.sast_tool`, `security.iac_scanner`.
- 6 new changelog categories: `sast-finding`, `license-risk`, `git-history-secret`, `security-header`, `container-vuln`, `iac-misconfig`.
- SBOM governance, license compliance policy, git history baseline management, and remediation decision tree added to `security-audit.instructions.md`.

### Changed
- Gate logic expanded: SAST critical findings, git history secrets, critical container vulns, critical IaC misconfigs, and (optionally) license denylist matches now trigger FAIL.
- Report format updated with 7 new metric lines and remediation guidance section.
- Machine-readable JSON summary expanded with 7 new metric fields.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **@security** skill — vulnerability scanning, CVE research, secret detection, OWASP pattern matching, file integrity hashes, supply chain audit, and security changelog management.
- `security-audit.instructions.md` — audit scheduling, changelog governance, hash registry management, and @reviewer enforcement rules.
- `starters/SECURITY_CHANGELOG.md` — append-only security finding log template.
- `starters/FILE_HASHES.md` — SHA-256 file integrity registry template.
- New config tokens: `paths.security_changelog`, `paths.file_hashes`, `paths.security_reports`, `security.audit_on_sprint`, `security.audit_on_dependency_change`, `security.tracked_files`, `security.cvss_*_threshold`, `security.cisa_kev_check`, `security.sec_id_prefix`.
- `@security` wired as optional sprint quality gate in `@sprint-lead` Phase 3.

### Changed
- `@sprint-lead` now has 6 named specialist agents (was 5).
- `severity-levels.instructions.md` table updated to include `@security`.
- Onboarding Step 6 now seeds `docs/security/` directory with security starter files.
