## 🔥 The Problem Everyone Ignores

You're using GitHub Copilot or Claude Code. They're fast. They're capable.

**They also:**
- Forget your project conventions after every session
- Ship code without tests, reviews, or documentation
- Require you to manually coordinate planning → coding → QA
- Lose all learned patterns when context resets
- Make inconsistent decisions across identical problems

You have a **powerful tool** with **no process**. That's not engineering — that's gambling.

## Introduction

agent-homebase is a portable, multi-agent operating system for software projects that brings structured process to AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenAI Codex. Instead of treating these tools as one-off code generators, it turns them into a coordinated delivery team with defined roles, contracts, and quality gates.

### What it does
The project ships a library of skills, instructions, and agent definitions authored once in plain Markdown, then resolved with project-specific tokens and emitted as copy-ready artifacts for any compatible coding agent. A single config file produces the deploy artifacts you drop into your repository.

You get a set of specialised agent roles you can call by name: a planner that scopes requirements, a PM that validates features against project goals, a sprint-lead that orchestrates implementation cycles, a QA agent that enforces tests and coverage, a reviewer that flags security issues and code smells, a docs agent, plus dedicated agents for architecture, research, bug capture, security, accessibility, performance, and onboarding.

The framework operates in three independent delivery modes layered on a shared protocol. Mode 1 (Team) gives you the interactive agents in your editor. Mode 2 (Orchestration) runs a dispatcher that pulls work from a queue and verifies results without human prompts. Mode 3 (Choreography) coordinates work across many projects with drift control. Each mode installs standalone, so you adopt only what you need.

Underneath, seven JSON schemas validate every artifact at build time, and the protocol layer (protocol-v1, frozen at 2.0.0) enforces structured return contracts so agents pass typed status objects rather than free-form prose. Built-in profiles cover React apps, TypeScript monorepos, and Python APIs, so you can be running in minutes.
Its purpose

The repo exists to fix the gap between capability and process in AI-assisted development. Today's coding assistants are fast and capable, but they forget conventions between sessions, ship code without tests or reviews, and produce inconsistent results across similar problems. agent-homebase wraps that raw capability in a repeatable software delivery pipeline: plan, validate, implement, test, review, document, deploy. The goal is to make AI assistance behave like a disciplined team rather than a fast but unreliable contractor.

### Why it is important
Most teams adopting AI coding tools are running powerful models with no governance around them. That works for snippets and prototypes, but it falls apart for production work where quality, security, and consistency matter. agent-homebase is one of the few opinionated, schema-enforced approaches that treats AI agents as part of a real software process rather than a chat sidebar.
A few things make it notable. Security is built in rather than bolted on, with fourteen automated checks covering CVEs, secret detection, OWASP patterns, SBOM generation, SAST, container scans, IaC misconfigurations, and supply chain audits, each finding tagged with an OWASP remediation class. The architecture is platform-neutral, so the same authored content deploys to Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex without rewrites. And the contract-first design means agents return validated structured data, which removes the guesswork and hallucination that usually creep into multi-agent setups.

For anyone using AI assistants for real engineering work, especially across multiple repos or with a team, it offers a path from chaotic prompting to a repeatable, auditable workflow that does not require building an agent framework from scratch.

## 💡 The Solution: A Professional Delivery Team in Your Config

**agent-homebase** is a portable, multi-agent operating system for software projects.

Skills, instructions, and agents are authored once in plain Markdown, resolved with your project-specific tokens, and emitted as copy-ready artifacts for **any** compatible coding agent — GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, or OpenAI Codex.

One config file transforms chaotic AI assistance into a structured software pipeline:

## 🎯 What You Get

### 13 Specialized Agent Roles

| Agent | What It Does |
|:------|:-------------|
| 🎯 **@pm** | Validates features through 5 structured tests — prevents scope creep before code is written |
| 📋 **@planner** | Scopes requirements, drafts sprint plans, estimates complexity |
| 🎬 **@sprint-lead** | Orchestrates complete sprint execution with zero manual coordination |
| ✅ **@qa** | Runs typecheck, lint, tests, coverage — blocks deploys on failures |
| 🔍 **@reviewer** | Reviews for patterns, security, performance — flags issues by severity |
| 🏗️ **@architect** | Designs approaches, writes ADRs, makes structural decisions |
| 📚 **@researcher** | Surfaces prior art with citations, identifies failure modes |
| 🐛 **@bug** | Captures bugs into structured, prioritized backlog |
| 📖 **@docs** | Keeps documentation in sync after every sprint |
| 🔐 **@security** | 14 automated security checks — see [details below](#-security-built-in-not-bolted-on) |
| ♿ **@a11y** | WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audits |
| ⚡ **@perf** | Bundle size, build time, dependency analysis |
| 🚀 **@onboarding** | Ramps up new team members and explains project conventions |

### 🔐 Security: Built In, Not Bolted On

`@security` runs **14 automated checks** as a sprint gate or on demand:

| Check | What It Catches |
|:------|:----------------|
| Dependency CVE scan | Known vulnerabilities in your packages |
| Active exploit research | CISA KEV catalog, proof-of-concept detection |
| Secret detection | API keys, tokens, passwords in source |
| OWASP pattern matching | Injection, XSS, auth failures |
| File integrity hashes | Unauthorized changes to tracked files |
| SBOM generation | Full software bill of materials |
| SAST scanning | Static analysis security findings |
| Git history secret scan | Secrets in old commits |
| License compliance | Denylist/allowlist enforcement |
| HTTP security headers | Missing CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options |
| Container image scan | Vulnerabilities in Docker images |
| IaC scanning | Misconfigurations in infrastructure code |
| Supply chain audit | Dependency provenance verification |
| Security changelog | Append-only finding log (SEC-NNN entries) |

Every finding gets an **OWASP remediation classification**: patched, delayed, no-fix, or zero-day — with timelines and effort tags.

### 7 Enforced Schemas

Every artifact is validated at build time — no more silent drift:

| Schema | Validates |
|:-------|:----------|
| `frontmatter-v1` | YAML frontmatter on every skill, instruction, and agent |
| `callable-v1` | Callable manifest on every skill |
| `project-v1` | A single project entry in a Mode 3 registry |
| `registry-v1` | A full Mode 3 choreography registry |
| `subagent-return-tier1` | Lightweight subagent return contracts |
| `subagent-return-tier2` | Standard subagent return contracts |
| `subagent-return-tier3` | Full subagent return contracts |

### 3 Ready-to-Use Profiles

| Profile | For |
|:--------|:----|
| **[react-web-app](profiles/react-web-app.config.yml)** | React + Vite single-page apps |
| **[monorepo-fullstack](profiles/monorepo-fullstack.config.yml)** | TypeScript monorepo (pnpm + Vite + Expo) |
| **[python-api](profiles/python-api.config.yml)** | FastAPI / Flask / Django backends |

## 🔀 Three Delivery Modes

agent-homebase ships as three **standalone, independently consumable** modes on top of a shared protocol layer. Use one, two, or all three:

| Mode | What It Is | When You Need It |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------------|
| **Mode 1 — Team** | A substrate of skills, instructions, and agents for interactive use | You want `@planner`, `@qa`, `@security`, etc. in your project |
| **Mode 2 — Orchestration** | A dispatcher that pulls work from a queue, invokes callables, and verifies results | You want non-interactive, issue-driven dispatch |
| **Mode 3 — Choreography** | Coordinates a program of works across many projects with drift control | You manage multiple projects and need cross-repo visibility |

Each mode is a standalone install. Adoption order is free. Adding a new mode doesn't modify existing ones.

> **Visual reference:** open [docs/command-centre-visual.html](docs/command-centre-visual.html) in a browser for an interactive cheat sheet covering all three modes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/j78f88/agent-homebase.git
cd agent-homebase

# 2. Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Choose your profile and generate resolved files
python init.py --config profiles/python-api.config.yml
# → resolved/skills, resolved/instructions, resolved/agents

# 4. Copy to your project
cp -r resolved/skills/* ../.github/agents/
cp -r resolved/instructions/* ../.github/instructions/
cp -r resolved/agents/* ../.github/agents/

# 5. Initialize planning files (first time only)
cp starters/SPRINTS.md ../
cp starters/BACKLOG_LEDGER.md ../docs/planning/
```

**Then use naturally:**
```
@planner scope the dark mode feature
@sprint-lead run Sprint 3
@qa check coverage for auth module
@reviewer look at the last 3 commits
```

## 🧠 Why It Works

### Thin Orchestration Architecture

```
@sprint-lead (coordinator)
    │
    ├── Reads plans
    ├── Tracks state
    ├── Manages workflow
    │
    └── Delegates ALL implementation to:
            ├── Unnamed subagents → write code
            ├── @qa → validate quality
            ├── @reviewer → check patterns
            └── @docs → update documentation
```

**The secret:** `@sprint-lead` never reads source code. It coordinates. This keeps context windows clear for what actually matters.

### Contract-First Design

Every agent returns **structured data** following JSON schemas:

```json
{
  "tier": 1,
  "agent": "qa",
  "status": "blocked",
  "summary": "2/5 quality gates failed",
  "blockerReason": "Coverage at 72% (threshold: 85%)",
  "findings": [...]
}
```

When `@qa` returns `status: blocked`, `@sprint-lead` knows exactly what to do. No guessing. No hallucinating.

### Protocol-v1: Frozen Contracts

`protocol-v1` is frozen at `2.0.0`. Every skill, instruction, and agent gets validated against JSON Schemas at build time. Frontmatter validation is strict by default. No more drift — if it builds, it conforms.

### Works Everywhere

author once → resolve with tokens → deploy to any platform:

| Platform | Status |
|:---------|:-------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | ✅ Ready |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Ready |
| **Cursor** | ✅ Ready |
| **OpenAI Codex** | ✅ Ready |

## 🗂️ Architecture (1 minute)

```
skills/           author once, token-templated, callable-v1 manifests
instructions/     shared rules, generic + configurable
agents/           per-agent body that wraps a skill
schemas/          7 JSON Schemas that gate the build
config/           project-specific token values
profiles/         pre-built configs (python-api, react-web-app, monorepo-fullstack)
command-centre/   contracts (protocol-v1, mode contracts, ADRs, ref impls)
        │
        ▼  python init.py --config <profile>
resolved/         deploy artifacts (skills/, instructions/, agents/)
```

`init.py` is the single source of truth for the build. It runs security validation, frontmatter validation (strict by default), resolves `{{tokens}}`, and writes deterministic output.

`resolved/` is build output — never edit it directly, never commit it.
