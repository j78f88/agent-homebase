# Architecture

Design decisions and rationale for agent-homebase.

---

## Overview

agent-homebase is a library of agent skills, instructions, and supporting infrastructure for VS Code Copilot agent mode and Claude Code. It provides:

- **13 specialized skills** for software delivery workflows (canonical source of truth)
- **13 agent wrappers** for VS Code (generated from skills with tool restrictions and subagent delegation)
- **25 instruction files** for governance and contracts: 11 generic files plus 14 configurable files
- **4-phase implementation** for production-grade execution

### Dual-Platform Architecture

Skills are the single source of truth. When `editor.target` includes `"vscode"`, `init.py` generates thin `.agent.md` wrappers that provide native tool restrictions, context isolation, and model selection. Claude Code users consume skills directly.

```
skills/                ← canonical source (both platforms)
  architect/architect.skill.md
  qa/qa.skill.md
  ...

resolved/              ← generated output
  skills/              ← always generated (resolved as SKILL.md per VS Code convention)
  agents/              ← generated only when editor.target includes "vscode"
  instructions/        ← always generated
```

**Best pattern:** Agent delegates to skill. Agent provides persona + tool boundary. Skill provides procedural knowledge + bundled assets.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Thin Orchestration

Orchestrators (`@sprint-lead`) delegate ALL heavy work to subagents:

```
@sprint-lead (thin)
    ├── Reads plans
    ├── Tracks state
    ├── Collects summaries
    └── Delegates to:
        ├── Unnamed subagents (implementation)
        ├── @qa (quality gates)
        ├── @security (vulnerability audit)
        ├── @reviewer (code review)
        └── @docs (documentation)
```

**Why?** Context limits. An orchestrator that reads source files and runs commands will exhaust its context window. Delegation keeps each agent focused.

### 2. Contract-First Design

All agent interactions follow defined contracts:

- **Return schemas**: Tier 1/2/3 JSON schemas define what agents return
- **Write permits**: Agents can only write to permitted paths
- **Severity levels**: Findings use consistent CRITICAL/WARNING/SUGGESTION

**Why?** Predictability. When `@qa` returns `status: blocked`, `@sprint-lead` knows exactly how to handle it.

### 3. Configuration Over Code

Behavior is controlled through `project.config.yml`, not code changes:

```yaml
quality:
  coverage_threshold: 85    # Change threshold without editing skills
  
commands:
  test: "pnpm test"         # Use project's actual commands
```

**Why?** Portability. The same skills work across different projects with different toolchains.

### 4. Progressive Enhancement

Four phases add capabilities incrementally:

| Phase | Capability | Required |
|-------|------------|----------|
| 0 | Security validation, observability | ✅ |
| 1 | Formal contracts and validator checks | ✅ |
| 2 | Durable execution, checkpoints | ○ |
| 3 | Sandboxed execution | ○ |
| 4 | Deterministic replay | ○ |

**Why?** Not every project needs full durability. Start simple, add phases as needed.

### When to Use Each Phase

**Phase 0** (Security): Always required. Protects against dangerous commands and path traversal.

**Phase 1** (Contracts): Always required. Ensures agents return predictable data for orchestration.

**Phase 2** (Durability): Use for sprints longer than 4 hours or when interruptions are likely. Enables checkpoint/resume.
- **Skip if**: Short sprints (<1 hour), disposable work
- **Use if**: Multi-day sprints, unstable network, need audit trail

**Phase 3** (Sandboxing): Use when running untrusted code or limiting resource usage.
- **Skip if**: Trusted codebase, local development only
- **Use if**: CI/CD pipelines, unknown dependencies, resource quotas required

**Phase 4** (Determinism): Use when reproducibility is critical (debugging, audits, compliance).
- **Skip if**: Results don't need to be bit-for-bit identical
- **Use if**: Regulatory requirements, troubleshooting non-deterministic failures

---

## Why 4 Phases?

### Phase 0: Foundation

**Problem**: Agent systems can execute dangerous commands, leak secrets, or produce unpredictable output.

**Solution**: Security validation in `init.py`:
- Command whitelist (no `rm -rf`)
- Path traversal detection (no `../../../etc/passwd`)
- Secret scanning (no API keys in config)

### Phase 1: Formal Verification

**Problem**: Agents return inconsistent data, making orchestration brittle.

**Solution**: JSON Schema validation plus Python validators:
- Return schemas enforce structure
- Validator checks enforce cross-field rules and write-permit boundaries
- FSM ensures valid state transitions

### Phase 2: Durable Execution

**Problem**: Long-running sprints can fail mid-execution, losing progress.

**Solution**: SQLite persistence + checkpoints:
- State snapshots at phase boundaries
- Resume from any checkpoint
- Bidirectional markdown ↔ SQLite migration

### Phase 3: Sandboxing

**Problem**: Agent tasks (tests, builds) can affect host system or access unauthorized resources.

**Solution**: Docker container isolation:
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, time)
- Network policies (deny by default)
- Capability framework (fine-grained permissions)

### Phase 4: Determinism

**Problem**: Replaying a sprint produces different results due to time, randomness, composition order.

**Solution**: Deterministic execution:
- Lamport timestamps (logical time)
- Prompt versioning (detect skill changes)
- Content-based tie-breaking (reproducible ordering)
- LLM config enforcement (temperature=0)

## Policy Validation Status

The current implementation validates contracts with JSON Schema and Python
validators. There are no Rego policy files in the repository at this point.
Older design notes considered Open Policy Agent/Rego for policy-as-code, but
the build and test path currently relies on `init.py`, `jsonschema`, and the
phase libraries under `src/`.

## Why Policy-as-Code Was Considered?

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Hardcoded Python** | Simple | Not configurable, hard to audit |
| **YAML rules** | Readable | Limited expressiveness |
| **JSON Schema** | Standard | Only validates structure, not logic |
| **Rego** | Powerful, auditable, standard | Learning curve |

### Candidate: Rego

Rego (Open Policy Agent) would provide:

1. **Declarative rules**: Easy to read and audit
2. **Composition**: Policies can reference each other
3. **Testing**: Built-in test framework
4. **Ecosystem**: Industry standard for policy-as-code

Example policy sketch:
```rego
# Violation if feature allocation exceeds cap
violation[msg] {
    input.constraints.featurePercent > 70
    msg := sprintf("Feature allocation %v%% exceeds 70%% cap", [input.constraints.featurePercent])
}
```

## Why 3 Return Schema Tiers?

### Tier 1: Analysis Only

Returns that produce no artifacts. Used for validation, recommendations.

```json
{
  "tier": 1,
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Analysis complete",
  "findings": [...]
}
```

**Use cases**: @pm validation, @qa pipeline, @reviewer feedback

### Tier 2: With Artifact

Returns that produce a single artifact (document, code file).

```json
{
  "tier": 2,
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Draft created",
  "artifactPath": "docs/draft.md",
  "artifactType": "draft"
}
```

**Use cases**: @planner drafts, @docs updates, @bug reports

### Tier 3: Composition

Returns with multiple artifacts, metadata, provenance. Used by orchestrators.

```json
{
  "tier": 3,
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Sprint complete",
  "artifacts": [...],
  "metadata": {...},
  "provenance": {...}
}
```

**Use cases**: @sprint-lead sprint completion

### Why Not One Schema?

- Tier 1 agents shouldn't need to specify artifact paths
- Tier 3 metadata is irrelevant for simple validations
- Validation can be stricter when tier is known

### When to Use Each Tier

**Use Tier 1** when:
- Agent performs analysis only (no files created)
- Returns findings, recommendations, or validation results
- Examples: `@pm` validating requirements, `@qa` checking coverage, `@reviewer` suggesting improvements

**Use Tier 2** when:
- Agent creates **one** artifact (document, code file, report)
- Artifact needs to be tracked for downstream processing
- Examples: `@planner` creating draft plan, `@docs` updating README, `@bug` writing bug report

**Use Tier 3** when:
- Agent orchestrates multiple subagents
- Need to track provenance (which subagents ran, how many retries)
- Need metadata (duration, commit count, coverage delta)
- Examples: `@sprint-lead` completing sprint, `@architect` generating multi-file solution

**Decision matrix**:
| Created Files | Orchestrates Others | Recommended Tier |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 0 | No | Tier 1 |
| 1 | No | Tier 2 |
| 0+ | Yes | Tier 3 |

## Why SQLite Over Other Databases?

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **JSON files** | Simple | No ACID, no queries |
| **PostgreSQL** | Powerful | Requires server |
| **MongoDB** | Flexible schema | Requires server |
| **SQLite** | Embedded, ACID, standard | Limited concurrency |

### Decision: SQLite

1. **Zero configuration**: No server to run
2. **ACID guarantees**: Crash-safe writes
3. **SQL queries**: Powerful ad-hoc analysis
4. **WAL mode**: Good read concurrency
5. **Portable**: Single file, easy to backup

For agent workflows with single-writer, SQLite is ideal.

## Why Lamport Timestamps?

### The Problem with Wall-Clock Time

```python
# Non-deterministic
event_a = {"time": datetime.now(), "type": "task_start"}
# ... some processing ...
event_b = {"time": datetime.now(), "type": "task_end"}

# Replay: wall-clock times will differ
```

### Lamport's Solution

```python
clock = LogicalClock()

event_a = {"time": clock.tick(), "type": "task_start"}  # time=1
# ... some processing ...
event_b = {"time": clock.tick(), "type": "task_end"}    # time=2

# Replay: logical times are identical
```

**Properties**:
- If A → B, then timestamp(A) < timestamp(B)
- Monotonically increasing
- Independent of wall-clock

## Configuration vs Instructions vs Skills

| Layer | Purpose | Location | Uses Tokens |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Config** | Project-specific values | `project.config.yml` | N/A |
| **Instructions** | Governance rules | `instructions/` | Some |
| **Skills** | Agent behavior | `skills/` | Yes |

### Flow

```
project.config.yml
        ↓
   init.py (token substitution)
        ↓
   resolved/skills/
   resolved/instructions/
        ↓
   .github/agents/
   .github/instructions/
```

---

## Security Model

### Defense in Depth

```
Layer 1: Config Validation (init.py)
    ↓ Command whitelist, path validation, secret scanning
    
Layer 2: Contract Enforcement (JSON Schema + Python validators)
    ↓ Return schemas, write permits, cross-field rules
    
Layer 3: Sandbox Isolation (Docker)
    ↓ Resource limits, network policies, capabilities
    
Layer 4: Audit Trail (JSONL logs)
    ↓ All operations logged for forensics
```

### Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Command injection | Whitelist + pattern detection |
| Path traversal | Validation + sandbox isolation |
| Secret exposure | Scanning + audit logging |
| Resource exhaustion | Container limits |
| Network exfiltration | Deny-by-default policies |

---

## Future Considerations

### Not Implemented (Yet)

1. **Multi-agent coordination**: Parallel agent execution
2. **Custom LLM backends**: Support beyond Copilot
3. **Visual workflow editor**: GUI for skill composition
4. **Plugin marketplace**: Community skill sharing

### Design Constraints

- **VS Code dependency**: Skills are VS Code Copilot agents
- **Single-writer**: SQLite assumes one writer at a time
- **Docker dependency**: Phase 3 requires Docker
